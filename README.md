# DSA Practice in Java

This repository contains my solutions and implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems using the Java programming language.

## Contents

This repository is organized into the following directories:

-   `arrays`: Contains implementations and solutions related to array-based data structures and algorithms.
-   `linkedlist`: Includes implementations of different types of linked lists and associated algorithms.
-   `stacks`: Contains code for stack data structures and problems solved using stacks.
-   `queues`: Implementations of queue data structures and algorithms utilizing queues.
-   `trees`: Covers implementations of various tree data structures (e.g., Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees) and related algorithms.
-   `graphs`: Includes implementations of graph data structures and graph algorithms.
-   `sorting`: Contains implementations of different sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort).
-   `searching`: Includes implementations of searching algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search).
-   `dynamicprogramming`: Contains solutions to problems using dynamic programming techniques.


## How to Use

Each directory contains Java files (`.java`) with the implementations and solutions. You can navigate to a specific directory and compile and run the Java files using a Java Development Kit (JDK).

For example, to run a file in the `arrays` directory:

1.  Navigate to the `arrays` directory in your terminal:
    ```bash
    cd arrays
    ```
2.  Compile the Java file (e.g., `ArrayOperations.java`):
    ```bash
    javac ArrayOperations.java
    ```
3.  Run the compiled class file:
    ```bash
    java ArrayOperations
    ```
